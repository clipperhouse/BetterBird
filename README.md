#Better Bird
**For a slightly better Twitter**

This Google Chrome extension will:

- Move content (timeline) to the left-hand side and the dashboard stuff to the right.
- Expose your @mentions and saved searches in the dashboard.
- Expand shortened URLs wherever possible, so you know where you are actually clicking.
- Speaking of which, there is no need to redirect through t.co or bit.ly, now is there?
- Widen the layout, and optionally use a nicer font (Georgia), which makes glib bullsh*t seem 0.1% more literary.

The stable release is in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dolfbfbhjniibjlmpebhdkjanjlcnolp?hl=en).

Uses the lovely Twitter icons from [Design Junction](http://designjunction.in/blog/2009/07/01/twitter-icon-for-your-blog/).

**If you feel like playing with the latest, possibly unstable update:**

Install the extension [here](https://github.com/clipperhouse/BetterBird/raw/master/src.crx). If you want to mess with it, [download as a .zip](https://github.com/mwsherman/BetterBird/zipball/master) or pull with Git.

(In Chrome, under Tools > Extensions there is a checkbox for “Developer mode” in the upper right. This will allow you to “Load unpacked extension...” from a local folder if desired.)
