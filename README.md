#Better Bird
**For a slightly better Twitter**

This Google Chrome extension will:

- Move content (timeline) to the left-hand side and the dashboard stuff to the right.
- Expose your saved searches in the dashboard; they are currently buried under the search box in the header.
- Expand shortened URL's wherever possible, so you know where you are actually clicking.
- Speaking of which, no need to redirect through t.co or bit.ly, now is there?
- Widen the layout, and use a nicer font (Georgia), which makes glib bullshit seem 0.1% more literary.

Install the extension [here](https://github.com/clipperhouse/BetterBird/raw/master/src.crx). If you want to mess with it, [download as a .zip](https://github.com/mwsherman/BetterBird/zipball/master) or pull with Git.

(In Chrome, under Tools > Extensions there is a checkbox for “Developer mode” in the upper right. This will allow you to “Load unpacked extension...” from a local folder if desired.)

More to come. When this is interesting enough to be a 1.0, I’ll release it in the Chrome Web Store.
