#Better Bird
**For a slightly better Twitter**

This Google Chrome extension will:

- Move content (usually your timeline) to the left-hand side and the dashboard stuff to the right
- Expose your saved searches in the dashboard; they are currently buried under the search box in the header.

To install, you can simply download as a .zip above or pull with Git.

In Chrome, go to Tools > Extensions and select the checkbox for “Developer mode” in the upper right. Then “Load unpacked extension...” and select the the downloaded source folder.

More to come. When this is interesting enough to be a 1.0, I’ll release it in the Chrome Web Store.
