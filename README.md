#Better Bird
**For a slightly better Twitter**

This Google Chrome extension will:

- Move content (timeline) to the left-hand side and the dashboard stuff to the right.
- Expose your saved searches in the dashboard; they are currently buried under the search box in the header.
- Expand shortened URL's wherever possible, so you know where you are actually clicking.
- Speaking of which, no need to go through t.co, now is there?
- Widen the layout, and use a nicer font (Georgia), which makes glib bullshit seem 0.1% more literary.

To install, you can [download as a .zip](https://github.com/mwsherman/BetterBird/zipball/master) or pull with Git.

In Chrome, go to Tools > Extensions and select the checkbox for “Developer mode” in the upper right. Then “Load unpacked extension...” and select the the downloaded source folder.

More to come. When this is interesting enough to be a 1.0, I’ll release it in the Chrome Web Store.
